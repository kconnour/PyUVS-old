This is info I could only find after much StackExchange digging...

If you install Sphinx, it gets associated with a Python version, which is bad
if you want to upgrade system-wide Python or use virtual environments.

sphinx-quickstart = <python> -m sphinx.cmd.quickstart
make html = <python> -m sphinx.cmd.build -b html <path to conf.py> <path to where to put the html files>
so I have to run this command to build the html from Sphinx installed in a venv:

/home/kyle/repos/pyuvs/venv/bin/python -m sphinx.cmd.build -b html /home/kyle/repos/pyuvs/builddocs /home/kyle/repos/pyuvs/docs
