.. note::
   I envision that PyUVS could and should have 2 interfaces:

   * Use data from .fits files. This is what every team member uses as far as
     I can tell. However, this is horribly antiquated.
   * Use data from a database. This is better in every way but alas I haven't
     implemented this yet.
