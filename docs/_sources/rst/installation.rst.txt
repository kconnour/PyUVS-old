Installation

There are (or will be) several ways to install PyUVS. Regardless of how you
choose to install the package, we highly recommend you use virtual environments
during the process. All that follows will assume you are using them.

*****************
PYPI installation

The package is coming to the PyPI soon!

*******************
Github installation
*******************
To install the latest version of PyUVS simply clone the repository from Github
(using :code:`git clone https://github.com/kconnour/PyUVS.git` from Terminal,
or clone using your favorite GUI). You can then install it with
:code:`<path to python interpreter> -m pip install <path to pyuvs>`. This
command will install PyUVS along with all of its dependencies.

You can now import PyUVS with :code:`import pyuvs`!

.. note::
   For users wishing to generate the latest documentation, the installation
   comes with a :code:`docs` option to install all documentation dependencies.
   Simply use :code:`<path to python interpreter> -m pip install <path to
   pyuvs>[docs]` to install these.
