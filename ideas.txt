            same as current l1bdataContents
        DataClassifier
            accepts l1b.DataContents and classifies a single file
        DataCollectionClassifier
            accepts DataFilenameCollection, ensures it's all l1b, then
            each method loops through it and creates a DataContents, which
            calls the DataClassifier methods.

            to exclude those that are relays)
