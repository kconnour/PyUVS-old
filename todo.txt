To-do:
- filenames.IUVSDataFilenames
--- pylint wants me to get rid of my TODOs
--- pylint says I have too many instance variables (20/7)

- misc.get_project_path
--- This is only needed to make documentation. Try to get rid of this soon.

- misc.orbit_code
--- I hate the name of this function. Try to think of something better

- science_week.ScienceWeek
--- I'm trying the eafp but lbyl just seems better...

Before 0.1.0:
- IUVSDataFilenameCollections should be a data structure. Add FileProperties
  as another class with methods that can act on IDFC
- Remove the folders so it's just from pyuvs.files import IUVSDataFilename
- pylint tests
