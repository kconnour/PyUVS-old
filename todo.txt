To-do:
- filenames.IUVSDataFilenames
--- pylint wants me to get rid of my TODOs
--- pylint says I have too many instance variables (20/7)

- finder.DataPath
--- I'm trying the eafp but lbyl just seems better...

- misc.get_project_path
--- This is only needed to make documentation. Try to get rid of this soon.

- misc.orbit_code
--- I hate the name of this function. Try to think of something better

- science_week.ScienceWeek
--- I'm trying the eafp but lbyl just seems better...

- General
--- I don't really like files, filenames, and finder. It seems there should be
    a unifying module name...

- Fixes
--- DataPath
--- DataPattern
--- glob_files
--- soschob
--- multi_orbit_files
--- orbit_range_files
--- IUVSDataFileCollection
