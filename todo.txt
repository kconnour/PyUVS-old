To-do:
- filenames.IUVSDataFilenames
--- pylint wants me to get rid of my TODO
--- pylint says I have too many instance variables (20/7)
- tests
--- I dunno how to run pylint on them but they seem good

- misc.py
--- Add .py file docstring for why it exists

- misc.get_project_path
--- Why do I need this?

- misc.orbit_code
--- Refresh + tests

- science_week.ScienceWeek
--- Clean up docstrings slightly
--- Significantly clean up unit tests (remove TestScienceWeek for instance)

Before 0.1.0:
- IUVSDataFilenameCollections should be a data structure. Add FileProperties as another class with methods that can act on IDFC
- Remove the folders so it's just from pyuvs.files import IUVSDataFilename
- pylint entire code
