Before 0.1.0:

- l1c files don't include muv or fuv data in the filename
- IUVSDataFilenameCollections should be a data structure. Add FileProperties as another class with methods that can act on IDFC
- Remove the folders so it's just from pyuvs.files import IUVSDataFilename
- Empty the __init__.py files and see if that gets rid of the tests in the doc
- Add unit tests to some of the functions
- Move /tests to within the pyuvs package + remove a bunch of crap in tests
